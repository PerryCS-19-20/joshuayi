            <i>What is a Solar Eclipse?</i>
        </h2>
        <p style=font-size:24px>
            Every once in a while, people go ouside to witness a solar eclipse.
            Many individuals believe it is one of natures most beautiful and awe-inspiring sights this world has to offer. However,
            what exactly are solar eclipses? According to NASA, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the earth and the sun. What we define
            as a solar eclipse is the shadow that the moon casts on the earth. The type of eclipses we see, however, depends on many different factors               such as how the moon passes the sun,
            and the location where one watches from.

            The photo above shows the differences between the various partial solar eclipses and a full eclipse. (Center example shows full solar eclipse)

        <p style="font-size:24px">
            As mentioned before, depending on ones location, individuals will see different types of solar eclipses. Whenever a solar eclipse comes around, its path always changes. Because of this, people may or may not be able to see it. Solar eclipses however, happen frequently. Although they may not all be full eclipses, the amount of solar eclipses that happen averages to around 3 a year. So it is very likely for anyone to see at least one. The photo below is an example of a path of a solar eclipse. In this case, one that passes the United States.

         <p style="font-size:15px">
            The August 21, 2017 solar eclipse is the first full solar eclipse to pass the United States in 38 years. Because of this, many people spent a lot of time, effort, and money to go see the solar eclipse in its full glory.

            Although solar eclipses are beautiful, they are dangerous as well. The sun is powerful enough to damage the eyes in direct exposure. Even during a solar eclipse. When watching any solar eclipse, full or partial, it is very important to have the proper eye wear to do so. This does not mean you can wear and use any regular sunglasses. There are specific glasses that are made so people can enjoy the solar eclipse. These glasses can be found online on websites such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2/140-7742407-2660552?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=solar+eclipse+glasses">Amazon</a>, or even at a local stores within a month of an eclipse.
