    <p>Hello, my name is Joshua Yi. I am from Washington however, I have lived in many other places as well. I was born in Anchorage, Alaska and moved to New Jersey and lived there for many years. After ten years or so we moved to Washington state. It was only recently that I moved to Arizona.</p>
    <ul>
        <h3>Here are something facts about me.</h3>
        <li>I am an Olympic style recurve archer. I am currently training to make it onto the USA team this up coming season.</li>
        <li>I play a lot of video games in my spare time and am very competitive. Some of the games I play are CS:GO, League of Legends, and Playerunknown's Battleground.</li>
        <li>A hobby of mine is to go hiking. I enjoy going on hikes, taking picture while walking through the trails.</li>
        <li>I like to eat food. Whenever I travel or get the chance, I like to try new foods and/or find great local restaurants</li>
        <li>Although I am Korean, I have never been to Korea. I would hope to go in the near future and get that off of my bucket list</li>
    </ul>
    I am relatively new at coding however, I think its interesting and fun. Although I enjoy coding, I currently am not sure if I should pursue a computer science/coding career. I am hoping that this class would help me solidify my choice.

    Out of all the weboages we have made on codehs, I thought <a href="https://codehs.com/editor/html/154695/438972/index.html">this</a> was my favorite.
