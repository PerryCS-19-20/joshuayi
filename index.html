    <p>Hello, my name is Joshua Yi. I am from Washington however, I have lived in many other places as well. I was born in Anchorage, Alaska and moved to New Jersey and lived there for many years. After ten years or so we moved to Washington state.<br> It was only recently that I moved to Arizona. My profile picture is a photo of Brady Ellison, USA's best male recurve archer, my idol.</p>
    <ul>
        <h3>Here are something facts about me.</h3>
        <li>I am an Olympic style recurve archer. I am currently training to make it onto the USA team this up coming season.</li>
        <li>I play a lot of video games in my spare time and am very competitive. Some of the games I play are CS:GO, League of Legends, and Playerunknown's Battleground.</li>
        <li>A hobby of mine is to go hiking. I enjoy going on hikes, taking picture while walking through the trails.</li>
        <li>I like to eat food. Whenever I travel or get the chance, I like to try new foods and/or find great local restaurants</li>
        <li>Although I am Korean, I have never been to Korea. I would hope to go in the near future and get that off of my bucket list</li>
    </ul>
    I am relatively new at coding however, I think its interesting and fun. Although I enjoy coding, I currently am not sure if I should pursue a computer science/coding career. I am hoping that this class would help me solidify my choice.

    Out of all the weboages we have made on codehs, I thought <a href="https://perryma.tk/joshuayi/solarEclipse.html">this</a> was my favorite.
